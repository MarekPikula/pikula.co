> FPGA developer by day, DevOps engineer by night.
>
> I strive to create high-quality, well-tested and documented solutions in
> established technologies while actively exploring the new and shiny. Deeply
> in love with functional programming (Scala ♥️) and declarative UI development
> (Flutter 👌). For tooling, automation, Docker and CI, I'm your man.
>
> I feel the best in complex projects requiring both system-level and in-detail
> perspectives, connecting multiple domains from hardware through gateware and
> firmware up to the software. There's nothing better than a perfectly
> integrated project delivered on time that serves the client's needs.
>
> In my spare time, I like to play tennis. I also have lots of 3D printing
> experience, which I gladly share, and a deep interest in space exploration
> and cutting-edge technologies.
