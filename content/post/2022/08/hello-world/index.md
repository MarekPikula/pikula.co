FPGA developer by day, DevOps engineer by night.

I strive to create high-quality, well-tested and documented solutions in
established technologies while actively exploring the new and shiny. Deeply in
love with functional programming (Scala ‚ô•Ô∏è) and declarative UI development
(Flutter üëå). For tooling, automation, Docker and CI, I'm your man.

I feel the best in complex projects requiring both system-level and in-detail
perspectives, connecting multiple domains from hardware through gateware and
firmware up to the software. There's nothing better than a perfectly integrated
project delivered on time that serves the client's needs.

In my spare time, I like to play tennis. I also have lots of 3D printing
experience, which I gladly share, and a deep interest in space exploration and
cutting-edge technologies.
